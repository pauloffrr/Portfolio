    "description": "My name is Paulo Rodrigues, a student in System Analysis and Development in Brazil — a program similar to Computer Systems Technology degrees in the US and Canada. I began my journey in tech in 2023 through self-learning and started college in 2024. I'm passionate about backend development, particularly with Java and Spring Boot, and I'm currently learning React to grow as a full stack developer. I'm eager to keep learning, build meaningful projects, and I'm actively seeking an internship opportunity to launch my career in software development."
